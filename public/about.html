<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Christopher Arias and let me tell you a bit about myself. Growing Up I was a little tech savy so as you could imagine, I always wondered how computers worked and how the certain different parts communicate to each other.I remember one time I had<br /> opened up a computer and dissasembled it. It took me a little while but eventually I was able to assemble it. I was never the kid to sit there and not do anything since I was always hyperactive. Guess that worked
  out in my favor because now im all hands-on. Since that day I was intrigued and set on technology, I always knew that I wanted a career in tech but didn't know how far it would take me. Most of my childhood was learning technology and playing soccer.<br />
